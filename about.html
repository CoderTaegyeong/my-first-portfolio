                <div class="section-head">About Me</div>
                
                <h class="section-subtitle">Who Am I?</h>
                <p class="sec-text">Hello, I'm Taegyeong Kim. TG or TK for short. I'm a junior web-developer who lives in Busan, Korea.</p>
                
                <h class="section-subtitle">How Did I make This?</h>
                <p class="sec-text">I made the website with HTML5 and CSS3. My first thought was my portfolio should look stylish. So I searched for hours and found some CSS and Jquery animations I could apply to the website.</p><p class="sec-text">I edited them little bit, and put them. Yet that didn't satisfy me. It didn't look like "my" porfolio.</p><p class="sec-text">I shouldn't have used someone else's works. I deleted all of the codes I got from others, and started to edit the website with my own codes.</p>
                
                <h class="section-subtitle">Why Did I Choose Coding for Profession?</h>
                <p class="sec-text">I was certain that I would become a classical music professor until I failed to enter a high school of art.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">Then I decided to go to Busan University of Foreign Studies and major in English that I was good at besides playing the piano.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">After I graduated, I kept searching on the Internet since I didn't know what to do.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">One day, I came across web design. I got some information about it, and I enrolled for an institute that teaches technologies to get a job. I received some money from the government while taking lessons on web design.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">First thing I learned was how to use Adobe Illustrator. However, I didn't like design classes.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">I started to learn HTML and CSS myself on W3Schools. When teacher started to teach coding, I already finished HTML and moved on to CSS. That was the time I began to like coding.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">Soon I made a decision to become a front-end developer.</p>
                
                
                <h class="section-subtitle">How Did I Learn to Code?</h>
                <p class="sec-text">As I mentioned before, I learned to code at the web design class of the institute for the first time. Teacher wasn't helpful because her lessons were heavily design-based.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">I went to W3Schools to learn HTML and CSS. After some months, I was able to create a website with a navigation bar and semantic tags.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">Then I moved on to Codecademy to learn JavaScript. I made it to lesson 4: Scope, but Codecademy didn't give adequate information on each lesson. I moved on to FreeCodeCamp instead.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">Unlike Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp provided every lesson for free. With detailed explanations, I was able to understand basic concepts of JavaScript.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">Still, FreeCodeCamp didn't have an app to study all the time, and their mobile page wasn't suited to exercises. I found SoloLearn.</p>
                <p class="sec-text">SoloLearn had great community feature to get help from other learners. When the lesson had inaccuracies or lacked some details, I looked comment section to see corrections from users. And the app was free. Now I'm at the finish line of basics.</p>
                
                
                <h class="section-subtitle">Why I like to Code?</h>
                <p class="sec-text">I like that coding has concrete formulas that have already assigned answers, but we could make various things freely by using it.</p>
