### Introduction
Hi, I'm Taegyeong Kim. I'm currently 23 years old, and a college graduate who doesn't have a job experience in Web Design. My major is English. For more information on who I am, please visit https://linkedin.com/in/taegyeong-kim-8521a8179. If you want to talk to me, come to my Twitter account or email address on my LinkedIn page.

### About Bookstore
The bookstore website I made is called 'A.Z and Co.' because I was watching Good Omens at that time. 'A.Z and Co.' is the name of the bookstore from Good Omens, an Amazon Prime TV series. We can see the Good Omens' novel at the front of my bookstore website. This website was made before I had knowledge of Responsive Web Design. I worked from September 9th, 2019 to September 17th, 2019.

Fonts I used: 'Book Antiqua' for the logo, 'Vollkorn' for the menu, buy buttons, section titles, 'Amiri' for the see more buttons, and 'Times New Roman' for the copyright part.

Images: Every book image I used is from Amazon, and I made the logo using Adobe Illustrator.

### About SkyDyve
This is a website for a travel agency. I used a template from templated.co to show that I could use a template.

### About Movieflex
This is my first work of Responsive Web Design. I wanted to make a website for movie streaming companies. I used the images of the movies I enjoyed watching. This website contains three major elements: Responsive design for various devices, Embeded Youtube video, and an animated photo slider.

Images: Background image is made from http://bg.siteorigin.com/ . Movie posters and header image are from searching on Google.
Photo Slider: From https://cssslider.com/
JavaScript and Jquery Codes: From searching Google about responsive Youtube video and reponsive web design.
