## Websites
1. About Bookstore
The bookstore website I made is called 'A.Z and Co.' because I was watching Good Omens at that time. 'A.Z.Fell and Co.' is the name of the bookstore from Good Omens, an Amazon Prime TV series.

-Fonts: 'Book Antiqua' for the logo, 'Vollkorn' for the menu, buy buttons, section titles, 'Amiri' for the see more buttons, and 'Times New Roman' for the copyright part.
